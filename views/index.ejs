    <p>Welcome to <%= title %>, a leading toy retailer in Vietnam. 
      Our scenario-based system enables efficient management and 
      real-time data monitoring across our numerous outlets.</p>

    <h2>Program Roles</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Admin:</strong> Manages user accounts and system settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Director:</strong> Views available products across shops, and monitors sales data.</li>
        <li><strong>Staff:</strong> Manages shop's products and keeps track of inventory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Each shop operates its own database to record transactions and manage inventory. 
      Monthly sales data is sent to the Director for analysis and reporting.
       This system streamlines operations and provides real-time stock information to the board, 
       facilitating informed decision-making.</p>
